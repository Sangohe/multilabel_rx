## To Do list
* Add a `README.md` in the experiment subfolder with information about the training 
* Create `util_scripts.py` with the following functions:
  * `evaluate_on_set:` takes a trained network and a trained dataset to generate a pickle with metrics and save the ROC curve for the given model
* Modify the model save in `train_single_network` to match the naming convention proposed in the group
* Write a better `README.md`
